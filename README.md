# Geochron

![Screenshot of website on different isze screens](/docs/screenshot%20of%20responsive%20pages.png)
Founded in 2015 by Dr Quentin Crowley, Geochron is a spin-out company from a research project in Trinity College Dublin. Geochron now offers a range of innovative environmental solutions, and is the first company offering customised remote sensing surveys of quarries in Ireland.

## Our Purpose
Integrating technology and innovation to provide solutions to environmental challenges.

## Services
Geochron Ltd offers a range of customised remote sensing services. Using state of the art drone technology and a range of sensors, our surveys incorporate:

- High-resolution orthorectified images. Aerial images are stitched together, and corrected for any distortion, to produce a detailed and interactive true colour image of the survey area.
- Three dimensional models. 3D models are generated from lidar (laser scanner) point clouds, or from 2D images. 3D models include digital elevation model (DEM), digital surface model (DSM), and customized 3D maps.
- Gamma spectrometry. Using specially developed gamma detectors, outputs include gamma dose rate, and concentrations of potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th). Gamma spectrometry outputs can be integrated into 3D models.

## Project
### Safe and sustainable supply of building materials

Funded by a European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Futures grant administered by GÃ‰ANT, Geochron was awarded an EU tender to conduct a survey of representative quarries supplying building materials in Ireland. Surveys are designed to assist quarries to demonstrate compliance with relevant environmental and radiation protection legislation, or for planning applications for new quarries or expansion of existing quarries.

### Applications

The project outputs serve as a unique and valuable resource for scientific research with a range of different applications, including:

- Resource Management: Assisting quarry owners and operators to manage their natural resources by providing volume estimates and high resolution images and datasets which they can share with potential customers.
- Land Use Planning: The high-resolution photogrammetry and lidar data offer detailed mapping of the quarries, to support planning of quarry operations. Maps and data can be also be used to support planning applications for expansion of existing quarries, or development of new quarries. 
- Geological Research: The collected datasets offer a detailed and high-resolution view of the Earth's surface within the quarries, providing geologists with valuable insights into the geological composition, structure, and dynamics. Researchers can use this information to enhance their understanding of local geological features and processes.
- Environmental Studies: The datasets contribute to environmental research by providing information on different environmental parameters, including 2D and 3D models of the quarry surface. 
- Radiation Protection: The gamma radiometric data can be used to demonstrate compliance with radiation protection measures. This is particularly relevant given the potential future scrutiny from the EPA and the increasing importance of adhering to EU regulations in the international marketplace.
